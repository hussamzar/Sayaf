          <h3>Secrets of Professional Plastering: Expert Tips</h3>
          <p>
              Good plastering is the foundation for professionally and durably finishing any walls or ceilings. But what are the secrets behind plastering that lasts a long time and looks flawless? In this comprehensive guide, our experts share the best tips and practices to ensure the quality of your <strong>plastering</strong> work. We will review the importance of choosing the <strong>right bat7a</strong>, the correct ratios for mixing materials, and how to avoid common problems like cracks and peeling. Follow these guidelines to achieve the best results in your projects.
          </p>
          <h4>The Importance of Good Surface Preparation</h4>
          <p>
              Before starting the plastering process, you must ensure that the surface is completely clean and free of dust, oils, or any impurities that could affect the mortar's adhesion. Any large cracks or holes must also be treated and filled to ensure a completely level surface.
          </p>
          <h4>Correct Ratios for Mixing Mortar</h4>
          <p>
              The success of plastering largely depends on the correct ratios of sand, cement, and water. Using the wrong ratio can lead to weak plaster or cracks appearing later. It is preferable to use <strong>fine and clean plastering sand</strong>, mixed with cement in specific ratios recommended by experts, with the addition of a suitable amount of water to get a consistent and easy-to-apply texture.
          </p>
          <h4>Professional Application Techniques</h4>
          <ul>
              <li><strong>Tartasha First:</strong> A thin layer of tartasha must be applied before starting the plastering, to increase the surface roughness and improve mortar adhesion.</li>
              <li><strong>Plastering Layers:</strong> It is preferable to apply plaster in two or three layers instead of one thick layer, to ensure consistency and reduce the chances of cracking. Each layer should be left to dry partially before applying the next.</li>
              <li><strong>Watering After Plastering:</strong> Spraying the surface with water regularly for a few days after plastering helps with the curing process and prevents cracks caused by rapid drying.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
              By following these expert tips, you can guarantee <strong>professional plastering</strong> that lasts for a long time and gives your project a perfect final touch. For more consultations on the <strong>best types of sand for plastering</strong>, contact Desert Sand Est.

          <ul>
              <li><strong>Modern Transport Fleet:</strong> Experienced suppliers have a large fleet of trucks and dumpers to ensure vehicles are available upon request.</li>
              <li><strong>Efficient Logistics Management:</strong> Routes and schedules are carefully planned to avoid traffic and ensure the fastest possible arrival.</li>
              <li><strong>Sufficient Inventory:</strong> Reliable suppliers maintain adequate quantities of key <strong>building materials</strong> in their warehouses to ensure a quick response to large orders.</li>
              <li><strong>Effective Communication:</strong> A good supplier ensures continuous communication with the client about the status of the order and the expected delivery time.</li>

          <h3>Tartasha: The Essential Step for Wall Strength Before Plastering</h3>
          <p>
              Before starting the plastering and final finishing work on walls, there is a vital, indispensable step: <strong>tartasha</strong>. This initial layer is not just a formality; it is the foundation that ensures the plaster adheres effectively and increases <strong>wall strength</strong> and resistance to external factors. In this article, we explain how to use tartasha correctly, and what its importance is in protecting concrete structures. At Desert Sand Est., we provide you with the best and highest quality tartasha in terms of <strong>roughness and cleanliness</strong>, to ensure long-lasting results.
          </p>
          <h4>What is Tartasha and Why is It Important?</h4>
          <p>
              Tartasha is a rough, initial layer of cement mortar that is sprayed onto concrete or brick surfaces before applying the main plaster layers. Its primary function is to create a rough (textured) surface that allows subsequent plaster layers to adhere more strongly, which prevents them from peeling or falling off over time. It also provides a primary protective layer for the concrete and helps to insulate it.
          </p>
          <h4>How Does Tartasha Contribute to Wall Strength?</h4>
          <p>
              Thanks to the tartasha layer, the surface becomes more cohesive and consistent. This cohesion reduces the chances of cracks occurring in subsequent plaster layers and increases the walls' resistance to impacts and moisture. Good tartasha means stronger and more durable plastering, and therefore, stronger and more resilient walls.
          </p>
          <h4>Specifications of High-Quality Tartasha</h4>
          <ul>
              <li><strong>Sufficient Roughness:</strong> The tartasha must be rough enough to provide a good surface for adhesion, without being excessively rough to cause problems with plastering.</li>
              <li><strong>Cleanliness:</strong> Using clean, washed sand free of salts and impurities ensures the strength of the tartasha and prevents spots or problems from appearing later.</li>
              <li><strong>Correct Mix:</strong> The ratio of cement, sand, and water must be balanced to obtain a strong and cohesive mortar.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
              At Desert Sand Est., we are proud to offer the finest <strong>tartasha</strong> that ensures a strong start for your project and contributes to achieving <strong>wall strength</strong> that lasts for decades.
